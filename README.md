# Galaxy Campaign World 2

**Required Mods**: Gravity Mod v1.2.1+

**Setup Instructions**: Download the Galaxy_World_2.zip, and then extract it. The "GravityMod" folder extracted from the zip needs to be placed in "...\Poly Bridge 2\Poly Bridge 2_Data\StreamingAssets\Levels". Note that if you already have the GravityMod folder from downloading a different world of the Galaxy Campaign, you only need to move the contents of the extracted GravityMod folder into the already existing GravityMod folder.  

**To Play**: Enable the "Load Custom Layout" setting in the Gravity Mod, then load a level from the normal campaign. The galaxy version of the level should load in place of the normal level.

**FOREWARNING**: Bridges made while playing the galaxy campaign will overwrite autosaves and may overwrite lowest budget autosaves, so be sure to
save these as their own files before playing the campaign, or else you may lose some of your bridge saves.

**Rules**:
- Do not let the vehicles touch the water, as that would ruin the spirit of the levels.
- Do not go around the planet in the wrong direction to collect the flag.

**Settings**:
The settings should automatically be set by PolyTech Framework when loading a level.
